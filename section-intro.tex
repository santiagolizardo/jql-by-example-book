\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this book is not to teach the Jira Query Language but to have a list of example queries Jira users can refer to when wanting to extract data from Jira quick.

\section{Typical reader}

The people who would benefit the most from reading this booklet are engineering managers, project managers, scrum masters and generally anyone who requires to find information in Jira fast, either to create reports, dashboards or simply wants to locate a ticket lost in a team's backlog.

\section{Previous knowledge}

There are no previous knowledge requirements but familiarity with the SQL (Structured Query Language) used in databases such as MySQL/Postgres would put the user in a great position to consume with or without modifications the examples presented in this book, or start writing queries from scratch.

\section{Out of scope}

Out of scope are the JQL functions that are introduced by marketplace applications, as it would be almost impossible to document them all and keep an up to date version of this document.

\section{Ficticious organisation}

The examples on this book are based on a ficticious organisation called Reconmap. Reconmap is an small software company with teams composed of developers, testers, product owners and so on.

Reconmap's teams work using Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum, and use Jira to plan projects and track work.
